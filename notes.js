/*      <h3>This is a game I created myself called 'The Hummingbird Flight'. Click on the blue bird to access the game. In this game, you have to dogde the clouds by jumping.

        <h3>This game is my recreation of the 'Angry Bird' game.

You have to knock the pigs out and you will get points for that.</h3>
        <h3>This is the recreation of the 'Trex' game you will find on Google Chrome. You have to press the space bar to jump to avoid touching cacti. You can press the restart button on the screen if you want to play again. The restart button only comes when you lose.</h3>
        <h3>This is a recreation of the 'space shooter' game which you might know how to play. You need to move your mouse and your spaceship will follow and then you will need to press space to shoot a bullet. You get one point for hitting a alien spaceship which is heading towards you.</h3>
        <h3>This is a game I made in which you have to click on all the coins and they will be destroyed. If you click on the coins they will be destroyed and the speed of the coins will increase. You get points for taking the coins.</h3> */
